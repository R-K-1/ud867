# Gradle for Android and Java

This is a set of demo app demonstrating how to use Gradle in conjunction with Java and Android.

Each directory contains a README.md or solution.gradle that will explain either
the concept being explored or the exercise at hand. For each exercise, hints
and a solution.gradle file are also provided.

Note that these demo programs are specifically concerned with the app build process, not writing
apps in the first place. 

If you're just starting out on your Android journey,
you might want to take Udacity's [Developing Android
Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) course.

The final application combining the concepts explored in all listed applications is in [Final Projects](https://github.com/R-K-1/ud867/tree/master/FinalProject)
